# Bee Distribution in California: Climate × Habitat Interactions

This repository hosts the data, scripts, and resources for our undergraduate research group exploring how **climate and habitat together shape bee distribution patterns in California**.

## Background
Two previous research groups examined climate and habitat separately, with limited significance until the state was divided into regions. Our aim is to bring these approaches together to better understand the interaction of climate and habitat in predicting bee distributions.

We will build on:
- **Lebuhn Lab: bees_climate project** (climate focus)
- **Lebuhn Lab: bees_habitat project** (habitat focus)
- **Alarcón-Cruz et al. (year)** [PDF in `/papers`]

## Goals
1. Combine climate and habitat datasets.
2. Explore regional variation in bee distribution.
3. Identify the strongest predictors of bee richness and composition.
4. Provide reproducible scripts and visualizations.

## Getting Started
- See `/guides/getting_started.md` for setup.
- Explore `/data` for available datasets.
- Run `/scripts/exploratory_analysis.R` for first plots.
