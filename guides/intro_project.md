# Project Introduction

## Motivation
California is one of the most bee-diverse regions in North America. Understanding the drivers of bee distribution is essential for conservation and habitat management. Climate and habitat each explain part of the story, but when studied separately they have limited predictive power. This project investigates how their **interaction** explains bee diversity patterns across regions.

## Previous Work
- **Climate group:** Found weak statewide effects, stronger when partitioned by eco-region.
- **Habitat group:** Similar results — little statewide significance
- **Key Literature:** 

## Approach
- Start with exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Use coverage-standardized diversity metrics.
- Compare models: climate only, habitat only, and climate × habitat interactions.
- Focus on **regional breakdowns** of California.

## Expectations for Undergraduates
- Learn basic GitHub workflows (commit, pull, push).
- Collaborate on R scripts.
- Document findings in `/results`.
- Ask questions and explore creatively!
